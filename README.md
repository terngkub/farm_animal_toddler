### About the game
* Click left and right to change animals.
* Click on an animal image to listen to the sound of that animal.
* The game is responsive and can also run on the mobile.

### How to run the game
* Clone or download the repo.
* The game requires to run in virtual host. For PHP, you can create it with below command in the root directory of the repo. Change the port if there is a port conflict.
	```
	php -S localhost:8080
	```
* Open the browser. You can access the game by
	```
	localhost:8080
	```
* You can also create virtual host with other tools. It's just that the browsers don't allow you to run javascript from local files.
